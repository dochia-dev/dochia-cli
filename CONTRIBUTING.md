## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Dochia Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By
participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to [contact@dochia.dev](mailto:contact@dochia.dev).

## License Agreement

By submitting a contribution, you certify that you have the right to do so and that your work is provided under the
Apache License 2.0. You agree it may be incorporated into both the open-source and commercial editions of Dochia.

## Open Source vs Pro Features

Dochia maintains both an open-source community edition and Dochia Pro.
To sustain development of both, we cannot accept contributions that
implement Pro-tier functionality in the open-source version.

**Before contributing major features**, please:

1. Check if similar functionality exists in Dochia Pro
2. Open an issue to discuss the feature scope
3. Get maintainer approval before starting development

This helps avoid disappointment and wasted effort on both sides.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

This project uses DCO instead of a CLA. All commits must be signed-off to
certify you have the right to contribute the code.

### How to sign-off commits:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

Or add manually:

```Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>```

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check [existing issues](https://github.com/dochia-dev/dochia-cli/issues) as you
might find that the problem has already been reported. When you create a bug report, please include as many details as
possible:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue
- **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem** with as much detail as possible

- **Describe the behavior you observed** and explain what behavior you expected to see
- **Include logs and error messages** if available

### Suggesting Features

Feature suggestions are welcome! Please check existing issues first to avoid duplicates. When suggesting features:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Provide a detailed description of the suggested feature**
- **Explain why this feature would be useful** to most Dochia users
- **Describe how it should work** with examples if possible
- **Consider the scope** - would this be better as a plugin or core feature?
